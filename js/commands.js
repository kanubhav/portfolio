    about: `From debugging embedded systems at Honeywell to verifying True Random Number Generators on an Arm SoC, 
my journey has been driven by a passion for secure and reliable hardware.

With over 4 years of full-time and student experience in embedded systems, SoC design verification, and hardware 
security, I‚Äôve developed strong skills in SystemVerilog, UVM, AXI/APB protocols, and security validation techniques.

Currently wrapping up my master‚Äôs at TUM, I‚Äôve complemented theory with hands-on work at Infineon, Adva, and 
Rohde & Schwarz‚Äîwriting testbenches, building verification frameworks, and even conducting side-channel injection 
attacks to evaluate robustness.

I enjoy solving complex problems at the intersection of hardware and security, and I‚Äôm always looking to learn, 
build, and contribute to systems that are not just functional but secure, efficient, and resilient.`,
